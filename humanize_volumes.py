"""
When the user executes stitch.py it processes all metrics files which are obtained by un-tarring of the archive file.
These files contain alphanumeric values for metrics objects and long integer values which are not in human readable
format.

This program processes the "processed-metrics" directory obtained after executing stitch.py and adds additional columns
in performance object files to do a lookup for user friendly object names. It also adds columns to equate user friendly
rates converting bytes per second to megabytes per second. This program helps in converting bytes to kilobytes.
Configuration files are used to add user friendly object names.
